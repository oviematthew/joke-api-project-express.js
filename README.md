# Joke API Project â€“ Express.js + Node.js

This project is a **RESTful API** built with **Express.js** and **Node.js** that allows users to interact with a joke collection. The API supports CRUD operations and integrates with an external programming joke API to fetch jokes from a third-party source.

Itâ€™s designed to demonstrate core backend development concepts such as routing, middleware, JSON-based data persistence, and working with external APIs using Nodeâ€™s `https` module.

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This project serves as a practical example of building a backend API with Express.js and Node.js. It is suitable for:

- Portfolio showcase
- Learning basic server setup and routing
- Exploring file-based JSON storage
- Practicing integration with external APIs
- Demonstrating full CRUD functionality

---

## ðŸ“š Concepts Demonstrated

- Express.js routing and middleware
- RESTful API design
- HTTP methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE
- Request validation middleware
- File system operations in Node.js
- JSON parsing and data persistence
- External API consumption using `https` module
- Clean project structure for maintainability
- Optional: Deploying to Render or Railway for free hosting
